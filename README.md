## Security of Control and Embedded Systems
This is a group project focusing on the analysis of the drone delivery system.

This paper proposes a threat model for an online retail company. This paper highlights different types of threat modelling methodologies and analysing them to find the threats associated with the system. Furthermore, the STRIDE threat model is used to identify potential threats that the system may have. Also, this paper looks at developing a set of security requirements for the system and identifying the major challenges to privacy and safety.
